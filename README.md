# vegaasen.com v6

# Introduction

This project represents the v6 of my own pages. 

# Repos for all of your versions?

Jeah..I know, I'll reassemble them in to tags instead - this is a cleanup-job I'll consider doing asap actually :-)

# Build / Distribute

Everything within this project is build using the following techies:

* Gulp
* Npm

## Building the application

First off run the following command in order to assemble all dependencies required for the project from npm (npm packages)

    npm install

After this, run the following command in order to perform various gulp-tasks:

    gulp

This executes the default task defined within the gulpfile.js. For more tasks refer to that file :-).

You may also use the built in webserver (gulp-webserver) by issuing:

    gulp webServer
